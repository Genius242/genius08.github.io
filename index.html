									<h2><a href="#">BIKE BUYERS PROJECT<br />
									(Excel)</a></h2>
									<p>In this new world where data has become an inevitable tool for both business owners and large organizations to gain a propelling insights that 
										drive to the growth and adjusment of shortfalls in their businesses, I tried to find out from a CSV file of bike buyers what are the influences
										for bike purchases in a distinct 3 continent namely: North America, Europe and Pacific. Just like any meticulous data analyst, below are steps taken for my analysis.<br />  
									The first step was to make the needed file ready. I went online to download the dataset. The data in the file was jumbled, with inconsistent formatting, missing values, 
									and duplicate entries. Cleaning up this data was a necessary first step towards obtaining useful insights. I eliminated duplicates, standardized date formats, and filled in 
									any missing data using Excel's  data cleaning functions.<br /> 
									I made charts and pivot tables that revealed hidden patterns. <br /> 
									 It was observed that those with average income greater than $40,000 purchased bike for both female and male gender, <br />
									 The Pacific region has a greater number of bike purchase than North America.
									  Also it was noted that the highest number of bike buyers fell into the middle age group and lastly commuters within range distance of 5-10miles purchased more bike than other distance range.<br /> 
									  I also created an interractive dashboard with the slicer tool and the pivot tables to see different patterns in relation to different field groups (Marital Status, 
									 Occupation, Car Owners and Education).

										<h2><a href="#">DATA EXPLORATION USING SQL<br />
										COVID 19</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this SQL project, I  thrived to understand the impacts of Covid 19 pandemic on the global scale with the Covid 19 dataset from World Health Organization. 
										I use SQL Queries to derive answers to some curiosities from the data. The data was first divided into two distinct data respectively. The new data namely CovidDeaths containing the death and cases field 
										and secondly the CovidVaccinations for the Vaccinations information.
										I discovered the Percentage of Death to the Population of each region and location, the total_cases percentage to the population of each location, the maximum death count
										and also the location with the highest infection.
